<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: Football</h1>

<strong>Interaction</strong>: 
The player will interact with the game using Makey Makey. I am doing this so it makes the game harder and more fun to play. I will use the makey makey to make the players actually physically throw the ball instead of just sitting in front of the of the computer. 


<strong>Description</strong>: 
In this game, a wide reciever will be in one of 3 positions. If the wide reciever is in the top position, and the ball is thrown into a hoop that is connected to the that position, then you score a touchdown. If not, you fail. You have 10 seconds to throw the ball into that specific hoop.
