<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: Football</h1>

<strong>Interaction</strong>: 
The player will interact with the game using Makey Makey. I am doing this so it makes the game harder and more fun to play. I want to keep the controls far from each other, so the player will have to move a bit to to make the character move in the game. The player is moving like the character, but it is a smaller version. 

<strong>Description</strong>: 
In this game, a wide reciever is able to move forward, backward, left and right and they can jump. A football will be coming from a quarterback and the wide reciever needs to get to the ball, catch it, and run into the touchdown. While catching the ball, there will be no defenders. However, after the ball is caught, defenders will try and prevent the player to reach the end zone. If you do not score, that automatically means that the other team scores. You can win the game if you score 42 points before the other team does.
